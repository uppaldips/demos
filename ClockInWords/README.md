The Conversational Clock 

Output the time in a conversational style. 

This is a jquery implementation to validate the input time in 24hr format and convert it into words. Open the HTML file "ClockInWords" and input time in 24hr format in the text box.

Input examples: 

00:00 is "midnight". 
00:05 is "five past midnight" 
00:01 is "just after midnight" 
23:45 is "a quarter to midnight"
